# Tensor Manipulation and Reshaping with TensorFlow

   This Colab notebook demonstrates basic tensor manipulation and reshaping operations using TensorFlow.

   ## Task 1: Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping

   The notebook covers the following operations:

   1. Creating a random tensor of shape (4, 6).
   2. Finding the rank and shape of the tensor.
   3. Reshaping the tensor into (2, 3, 4) and transposing it to (3, 2, 4).
   4. Broadcasting a smaller tensor (1, 4) to match the larger tensor and adding them.

   ## Usage

   To run this notebook, simply open it in Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially. Ensure that you have TensorFlow installed in your environment.
