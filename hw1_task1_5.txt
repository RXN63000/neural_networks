5 Explain how broadcasting works in TensorFlow.


Broadcasting in TensorFlow is a powerful mechanism that enables element-wise operations between tensors with different shapes, without explicit loops or excessive memory usage.

Here's how it works:

Shape Compatibility:

Starting from the trailing (rightmost) dimensions, TensorFlow compares the shapes of the tensors.
Dimensions must either be equal or one of them must be 1 for broadcasting to occur.
Virtual Stretching:

The smaller tensor is not physically copied or duplicated in memory.
Instead, TensorFlow conceptually expands it along dimensions with size 1 to match the larger tensor's shape.
Element-wise Operation:

Once the shapes are aligned, the operation (e.g., addition, multiplication) is performed element-by-element as if the tensors had identical shapes.
Benefits of Broadcasting:

Concise Code: Eliminates the need for manual looping over tensor elements.
Efficiency: Avoids creating large intermediate copies of tensors, saving memory and computation time.
In essence, broadcasting provides a convenient and efficient way to work with tensors of varying dimensions in TensorFlow, making code more readable and performant.
